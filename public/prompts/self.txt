# Self Review

## Purpose

*Contextualize the subject's self-awareness, motivations, and insight.*

## Example Questions

- What actions have you taken in the last year to improve? Which of those are you most proud of?
- What are you most proud of achieving: last month, last year, in all your life?
- Think of a time you last faced a significant challenge (that maybe even felt impossible at the time). What actions did you take, and how did you tackle this?
- When did you last fail to meet your goals? What actions did you take after this?
- What is the greatest challenge you are facing right now?
- If you could change only one thing this year, what would it be?
- If you did everything all over again, where would you first make a significant change? How would that change where you are today?
