# Upward Feedback

*A direct report who has been supervised by the subject (the closer the better)*

## Purpose

A reflection on the subject's communication, motivation, and supportiveness. Direct reports give a clear indication of the culture and emotions that a manager cultivates. Is it one of trust, fairness, and openness?

## Example Questions

- **How would you describe their communication and clarity in setting direction or expectations for the team?**
- **In what ways does this leader recognize or reward good performance?** (*Do you feel appreciated for your contributions?*)
- **Can you share an example of a time when this manager’s coaching or feedback helped you improve, or when a lack of guidance hindered you?** (*This can reveal their effectiveness in developing team members.*)
- **What is one thing you wish [Leader’s Name] would *start*, *stop*, or *continue* doing to better lead the team?**
- How did your manager hold you and your peers accountable for producing your best work?
- When did you last provide feedback to the subject? How was this process?
- How well did your manager support your personal and professional growth?
- How does your manager support your well-being at this company?
